  "headline": "{article title}",
  "description": "{excerpt}",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "@id": "https://g2middleeast.com/team/tim-jacobs#person"
  },
  "publisher": {"@id": "https://g2middleeast.com/#organization"},
  "datePublished": "{date}",
  "isPartOf": {

#### 2. **ProjectDetail.tsx - Enhanced Event Schema** ‚úÖ

**Implementation:** Added comprehensive Event schema for high-profile government projects, particularly Papal Mass and Queen Elizabeth State Visit.

**File Modified:** `/home/user/webapp/src/pages/ProjectDetail.tsx`

**Projects Enhanced:**

2. **State Visit of H.M. Queen Elizabeth II**

**Schema Features:**

**Sample Schema (Papal Mass):**
```json
{
  "@type": "Event",
  "@id": "https://g2middleeast.com/projects/papal-mass-abu-dhabi#event",
  "name": "Papal Mass Abu Dhabi 2019 - Pope Francis Historic Visit",
  "description": "The historic Papal Mass in Abu Dhabi on February 5, 2019...",
  "startDate": "2019-02-05T10:30:00+04:00",
  "endDate": "2019-02-05T14:00:00+04:00",
  "location": {
    "@type": "Place",
    "name": "Zayed Sports City Stadium",
    "address": {
      "@type": "PostalAddress",
      "addressLocality": "Abu Dhabi",
      "addressCountry": "AE"
    }
  },

  },
  "attendees": {
    "@type": "QuantitativeValue",
    "value": 180000,
