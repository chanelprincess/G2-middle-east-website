## üîç Verification Troubleshooting

### DNS Records Not Verifying After 1+ Hours

**Check DNS Propagation:**
```bash
# Check if records are visible globally
# Visit: https://dnschecker.org

# Enter your domain: g2middleeast.com
# Select record type: TXT
# Check if Resend records appear
```

**Common Issues:**
- [ ] **Wrong Name Field:**
  - SPF should be: `@` or empty (root domain)
  - DKIM should be: `resend._domainkey` (exact)
  - DMARC should be: `_dmarc` (exact)

- [ ] **Extra Characters:**
  - [ ] No quotes around TXT values (some providers add automatically)
  - [ ] No trailing dots in Name field
  - [ ] No extra spaces in Value field

- [ ] **TTL Too High:**
  - [ ] Change TTL to 3600 (1 hour) or lower
  - [ ] This speeds up propagation

### Emails Going to Spam

**This is normal initially!**

**To improve deliverability:**
- [ ] Complete domain verification (all 3 records)
- [ ] Send a few test emails first
- [ ] Ask recipients to mark as "Not Spam"
- [ ] Build sender reputation gradually
- [ ] For production, consider SPF, DKIM alignment

### 403 Error Persists After Verification

**Solutions:**
- [ ] Refresh Resend dashboard
- [ ] Check domain shows "Verified" status
- [ ] Restart your development server
- [ ] Clear any caching in your application
- [ ] Wait 5-10 minutes after verification
