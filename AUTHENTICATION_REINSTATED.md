# Authentication Requirements Reinstated

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED AND VERIFIED**

---

## Overview

Login requirements have been fully reinstated for both the **Projects** and **Whitepapers** sections of the G2 Middle East website. Both sections now require user authentication before accessing protected content.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Projects Section

**Files Modified:**
- `src/index.tsx` - Removed temporary authentication bypass

**Routes Protected:**
```typescript
// Projects listing page
app.get('/projects', requireProjectsAuth, async (c) => {
  const user = c.get('projectsUser') as ProjectsAuth.UserSession
  // ... protected content
})

// Individual project pages
app.get('/projects/:slug', requireProjectsAuth, async (c) => {
  const user = c.get('projectsUser') as ProjectsAuth.UserSession
  // ... protected content
})
```

**Behavior:**
- ✅ Unauthenticated users redirected to `/projects/login`
- ✅ HTTP 302 redirect with `location: /projects/login`
- ✅ Session-based authentication required
- ✅ User session validated via middleware

### 2. Whitepapers Section

**Files Modified:**
- `src/index.tsx` - Removed temporary authentication bypass

**Routes Protected:**
```typescript
// Whitepapers listing page
app.get('/whitepapers', async (c) => {
  const user = await requireAuth(c)
  if (user instanceof Response) return user
  // ... protected content
})
```

**Behavior:**
- ✅ Unauthenticated users redirected to `/whitepapers/login`
- ✅ HTTP 302 redirect with `location: /whitepapers/login`
- ✅ Session-based authentication required
- ✅ User must be approved by admin to access

---

## Code Changes

### Before (Authentication Bypassed)
```typescript
// TODO: REMOVE BEFORE PRODUCTION - Authentication temporarily disabled for editing
// PRODUCTION VERSION: app.get('/projects', requireProjectsAuth, async (c) => {
app.get('/projects', async (c) => {
  // TODO: REMOVE BEFORE PRODUCTION - Restore this line:
  // const user = c.get('projectsUser') as ProjectsAuth.UserSession
  
  return c.render(<ProjectsPage />, { ... })
})
```

### After (Authentication Enforced)
```typescript
// Projects Page - Protected (Requires Authentication)
app.get('/projects', requireProjectsAuth, async (c) => {
  const user = c.get('projectsUser') as ProjectsAuth.UserSession
  
  return c.render(<ProjectsPage />, { ... })
})
```

## Authentication Flow

### Projects Section

1. **Unauthenticated Access Attempt**
   - User visits `/projects` or `/projects/:slug`
   - Middleware `requireProjectsAuth` checks for session cookie
   - No valid session found → 302 redirect to `/projects/login`

2. **Registration Process**
   - User visits `/projects/register`
   - Fills comprehensive registration form (name, company, email, etc.)
   - Account created with `is_active=0` (pending approval)
   - Confirmation page displayed

3. **Admin Approval**
   - Admin reviews registration in dashboard
   - Admin approves or denies access
   - User notified via email (when email system is active)

4. **Login Process**
   - User visits `/projects/login`
   - Enters email and password
   - System validates credentials
   - System checks if `is_active=1` (approved)
   - Session cookie set (HttpOnly, Secure)
   - Redirect to `/projects/dashboard`

5. **Authenticated Access**
   - User visits `/projects` or `/projects/:slug`
   - Middleware validates session cookie
   - User session loaded from database
   - Access granted to protected content

### Whitepapers Section

1. **Unauthenticated Access Attempt**
   - User visits `/whitepapers`
   - Function `requireAuth` checks for session cookie
   - No valid session found → 302 redirect to `/whitepapers/login`

2. **Registration Process**
   - User visits `/whitepapers/register`
   - Fills registration form
   - Account created with `is_approved=0` (pending approval)
   - Redirect to `/whitepapers/pending`

3. **Admin Approval**
   - Admin reviews registration in `/admin/users`
   - Admin approves or denies access
   - User notified via email

4. **Login Process**
   - User visits `/whitepapers/login`
   - Enters username and password
   - System validates credentials
   - System checks if `is_approved=1`
   - Session cookie set
   - Redirect to `/whitepapers`

5. **Authenticated Access**
   - User visits `/whitepapers`
   - Function `requireAuth` validates session
   - User data loaded
   - Access granted to whitepaper listing
   - Downloads tracked in database
