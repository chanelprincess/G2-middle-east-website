# Domain Transfer Guide: g2middleeast.com ‚Üí Cloudflare

**Date Started:** 2025-10-19  
**Domain:** g2middleeast.com  
**From:** Domain.com  
**To:** Cloudflare Registrar

---

## ‚úÖ **Why Transferring to Cloudflare**

### Cost Savings
- **Domain Registration:** $8.86/year (vs Domain.com ~$15.99/year)
- **SSL Certificate:** FREE (vs Domain.com $99.95/year)
- **Annual Savings:** ~$107/year
- **3-Year Savings:** ~$321

### Benefits
- ‚úÖ Free automatic SSL certificates (no manual CSR/validation)
- ‚úÖ Integrated management (domain + DNS + SSL + CDN in one place)
- ‚úÖ No coordination between registrar and DNS provider
- ‚úÖ Developer-friendly with full API access
- ‚úÖ DDoS protection and security included

### Email Independence
- ‚úÖ Using Google Workspace for email (completely separate)
- ‚úÖ No email disruption during transfer
- ‚úÖ MX records already in Cloudflare DNS

---

## üìã **Step 1: Domain.com - Request Authorization Code**

### Current Dialog
You're seeing: "Request Authorization code" with options:
- "I'll do it myself" ‚Üí Setup Host Records
- "I need more help" ‚Üí Chat With An Expert

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Decision

**DO NOT click "Setup Host Records"** - This is unnecessary because:
1. Your DNS is already managed by Cloudflare (nameservers already pointed)
2. All DNS records are already configured in Cloudflare
3. Host records are only needed if using Domain.com DNS

### ‚úÖ What to Do

**Click: "Continue With Transfer"** (bottom right button)

This will:
1. Show you the authorization/EPP code
2. Allow you to copy the code
3. Proceed with the transfer without changing DNS

**The authorization code dialog is just informing you about optional DNS setup help - you can ignore it since DNS is already configured.**

---

## üìã **Step 2: Get Authorization Code**

After clicking "Continue With Transfer":

1. **Copy the Authorization Code**
   - It will look something like: `Ab12Cd34Ef56`
   - Copy it to clipboard
   - Save it somewhere safe (you'll need it for Cloudflare)

2. **Verify Domain is Unlocked**
   - Domain lock should be disabled
   - Transfer lock should be off
   - If not, Domain.com will guide you to unlock it

3. **Verify Admin Email Access**
   - Make sure you can access the admin email for the domain
   - Transfer approval email will be sent there

---

## üìã **Step 3: Cloudflare - Initiate Transfer**

Once you have the authorization code:

### 3.1 Go to Cloudflare Registrar

## üéâ **Step 6: After Transfer Completes**

### Automatic Actions (Cloudflare Handles)
- ‚úÖ Domain registration extended by 1 year
- ‚úÖ Free Universal SSL certificate activated automatically
- ‚úÖ All DNS records preserved and active
- ‚úÖ Cloudflare becomes registrar of record

### Manual Actions Required

#### 6.1 Enable Free SSL Certificates
Since DNS is already on Cloudflare, free SSL is already active, but verify:

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard ‚Üí g2middleeast.com
2. Navigate to **SSL/TLS** ‚Üí **Edge Certificates**
3. Verify **Universal SSL** is active (should show "Active" status)

#### 6.2 Change SSL Mode to Full (Strict)
Now you can use Cloudflare's Origin CA certificate (free):

**Option A: Use Cloudflare Origin CA Certificate (Recommended)**

1. **Create Origin Certificate:**
   ```bash
   # In Cloudflare Dashboard:
   SSL/TLS ‚Üí Origin Server ‚Üí Create Certificate
   ```
   
2. **Download:**
   - Origin Certificate (.pem)
   - Private Key (.key)
   
3. **Install on Domain.com Server:**
   - Upload via cPanel SSL/TLS Manager
   - Or contact Domain.com support for installation
   
4. **Change SSL Mode:**
   ```bash
   # After origin certificate installed:
   curl -X PATCH "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/3680b593a0877c78cf613968aa3f2351/settings/ssl" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --data '{"value":"strict"}'
   ```

**Option B: Cancel Domain.com SSL (Save $99.95)**

Since you now have free Cloudflare SSL:
1. Contact Domain.com to cancel Order #408458756
2. Request refund if possible
3. Use Cloudflare Origin CA certificate instead (free, auto-renewing)

#### 6.3 Update Domain Auto-Renewal
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard ‚Üí Domain Registration
2. Enable **Auto-Renewal** for g2middleeast.com
3. Cloudflare will auto-renew at cost price ($8.86/year)

#### 6.4 Re-enable WHOIS Privacy
If you disabled it for transfer:
1. Cloudflare Dashboard ‚Üí Domain Registration
2. Enable **WHOIS Privacy Protection** (free)
3. Your personal info will be redacted

---

## üîê **DNS Records Verification**

### Current DNS Records (Already in Cloudflare)

Your DNS is already configured and won't change during transfer:

#### A Records
- **@** (root) ‚Üí 209.17.116.163 (Domain.com hosting)
- **www** ‚Üí 209.17.116.163 (Domain.com hosting)

#### MX Records (Google Workspace)
- Priority 1: smtp.google.com
- Priority 10: feedback-smtp.ap-northeast-1.amazonses.com

#### CNAME Records
- **_438e4ac31dc0c2ea7d52cf07d300e310** ‚Üí sectigo.com (SSL validation - can delete after transfer)

#### Other Records
- Various verification records (Google, etc.)

**Action:** No changes needed - all records stay active during and after transfer

## üí° **What About Domain.com SSL Certificate?**

### Current Status
- Order #408458756 (Domain.com Premium SSL - $99.95/year)
- Status: Pending validation (~10+ hours)
- Not yet installed

### Recommendation After Transfer

**Option 1: Cancel Domain.com SSL (Recommended)**
- Contact Domain.com support
- Cancel Order #408458756
- Request refund (not yet delivered)

- **Saves:** $99.95/year

**Option 2: Complete Domain.com SSL**

- Switch to Cloudflare Origin CA after expiration
- **Cost:** $99.95 (already paid)

**My Recommendation:** Cancel Domain.com SSL and use Cloudflare's free solution:

- ‚úÖ 15-year validity
- ‚úÖ Same security level
