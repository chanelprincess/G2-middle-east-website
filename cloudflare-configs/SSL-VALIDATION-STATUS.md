## ‚è±Ô∏è What Happens Next

### Automatic Validation Process

Domain.com (via Sectigo) will now automatically:

1. **Check DNS Records** (every few minutes)
   - Query: `_438e4ac31dc0c2ea7d52cf07d300e310.g2middleeast.com`
   - Looking for: CNAME pointing to their validation server
   - Status: ‚úÖ Record is live and ready

2. **Verify Domain Ownership** (5-30 minutes typical)
   - Sectigo's servers will query Cloudflare DNS
   - Match the CNAME record against their validation database
   - Confirm you control the domain

3. **Issue Certificate** (immediately after validation)
   - Generate SSL certificate for www.g2middleeast.com
   - Sign with Sectigo CA (Certificate Authority)
   - Make available for download in Domain.com control panel

---

## üìß What to Expect

### Email Notifications

You should receive email notifications from Domain.com at:
- **Validation Started:** "Domain validation in progress"
- **Validation Complete:** "Domain validated successfully"
- **Certificate Issued:** "Your SSL certificate is ready"

Check your email inbox (including spam folder) for updates.

### Domain.com Control Panel

You can also check status in the Domain.com SSL Control Panel:
- Status will update from "Pending Validation" to "Active"
- Download button will appear when certificate is ready
- Typically shows real-time validation progress

---

## ‚è∞ Expected Timeline

| Stage | Typical Duration | Status |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| **DNS Propagation** | 1-5 minutes | ‚úÖ Complete (Cloudflare is fast) |
| **Validation Check** | 5-30 minutes | ‚è≥ In Progress |
| **Certificate Issuance** | 1-5 minutes | ‚è≥ Awaiting validation |
| **Total Time** | **10-40 minutes** | ‚è≥ Started at 15:32 UTC |

**Expected Completion:** ~15:45 - 16:10 UTC (2025-10-18)

**Option A: cPanel (Recommended for Domain.com hosting)**
1. Domain.com cPanel ‚Üí Security ‚Üí SSL/TLS Manager
2. Upload certificate + private key + CA bundle
3. Install for www.g2middleeast.com

**Option B: Manual Nginx (VPS/Dedicated only)**
1. Upload certificates to `/etc/ssl/certs/`
2. Update nginx configuration
3. Reload nginx

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Validation Record Retention
- **Keep this CNAME record** until certificate is issued
- **Can be deleted** after successful validation (optional)
- **No impact** on website or email if kept permanently
- **Recommended:** Keep it for easier certificate renewals

### Certificate Renewal (Future)
When your certificate expires (~1 year):
1. Domain.com may reuse the same validation record
2. If kept, validation will be instant
3. If deleted, you'll need to add a new validation record

### Troubleshooting
If validation takes longer than 1 hour:
1. Verify CNAME record still exists in Cloudflare
2. Check Domain.com control panel for error messages
3. Contact Domain.com support with Order #408458756
4. Ensure no DNS caching issues
