## 3. ProjectDetail.tsx - Individual Project Pages

**Purpose:** Rich Event schema for each major project, establishing credentials and authority.

**Placement:** Add to each project detail page dynamically based on project slug. This requires modifying ProjectDetail.tsx to generate schema per project.

**Implementation Note:** You'll need to create a function that generates schema based on the `projectsData` object. Here's the template:

### Code Template for Individual Projects

```tsx
{/* Schema.org Structured Data - Individual Project */}
{(() => {
  // Example for Papal Mass - replicate for all 42 projects
  const projectSchemas = {

## 6. Implementation Instructions

### Step 1: Add to Home.tsx (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

1. Open `/home/user/webapp/src/pages/Home.tsx`
2. Scroll to the bottom, just before the closing `</PageLayout>` tag
3. Copy the entire Home.tsx schema block from Section 1 above
4. Paste it before `</PageLayout>`
5. Save file

### Step 2: Add to Projects.tsx

1. Open `/home/user/webapp/src/pages/Projects.tsx`
2. Scroll to bottom before `</PageLayout>`
3. Copy Projects.tsx schema from Section 2
4. Paste and save

### Step 3: Add to Perspectives.tsx

1. Open `/home/user/webapp/src/pages/Perspectives.tsx`
2. Scroll to bottom before closing tag
3. Copy Perspectives.tsx schema from Section 4
4. Paste and save

### Step 4: Dynamic Schema for Individual Pages

For individual project and perspective pages, you'll need to:

**Option A: Manual (Quick Start)**
- Copy the template for top 5 projects (Papal Mass, Queen Elizabeth, COP27, Expo 2020, FIFA World Cup)
- Manually add schema to each project detail page

**Option B: Programmatic (Recommended)**
- Create a `getProjectSchema()` function in `ProjectDetail.tsx`
- Map project slugs to schema templates
- Dynamically generate schema based on current page

### Step 5: Test & Validate

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/user/webapp && npm run build
   ```

2. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   pm2 restart g2-middle-east
   curl http://localhost:3000 | grep "application/ld+json"
   ```

3. **Validate with Google Rich Results Test:**
   - Go to: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
   - Test homepage: `https://g2middleeast.com`
   - Test projects page: `https://g2middleeast.com/projects`
   - Test perspectives: `https://g2middleeast.com/perspectives`

4. **Validate with Schema.org Validator:**
   - Go to: https://validator.schema.org/
   - Paste JSON-LD code directly or test URLs

### Step 6: Deploy to Production

```bash
cd /home/user/webapp
npm run build
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name g2-middle-east
```

### Step 7: Submit to Search Engines

Once deployed:
1. **Google Search Console:** Submit updated sitemap
2. **Monitor:** Check Enhancements â†’ Structured Data for new rich results
