      "description": "G2 Middle East & Africa is the region's premier independent strategic advisor and government event management agency, specializing in sovereign-level advisory, state visit coordination, diplomatic protocol management, international summit delivery, and mega-event architecture across the Middle East and Africa. Established as the regional hub of the global Casta Diva Group network, G2 operates with complete independence from production and AV vendors, ensuring objective strategic counsel focused exclusively on protecting sovereign interests and advancing client objectives. With over 20 years of combined leadership experience under Regional COO Tim Jacobs, our team has delivered 50+ major government events including the historic Papal Mass Abu Dhabi 2019 (180,000 attendees), State Visit of H.M. Queen Elizabeth II to the UAE, COP27 Egypt and COP28 UAE climate summits, Expo 2020 Dubai (24 million visitors), FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 (3.4 million attendees), Special Olympics World Games Abu Dhabi, and numerous presidential and royal visits requiring absolute protocol precision and diplomatic excellence. Our comprehensive service portfolio encompasses government event management, state visit coordination, diplomatic protocol advisory, sovereign branding and strategic positioning, crisis communications and reputation management, international summit management (COP, G20, UN conferences), mega-event architecture and delivery (World Expos, FIFA World Cup, Olympic Games), and luxury brand experiences tailored to high-net-worth audiences in the GCC region. As cultural fluency experts with bilingual English-Arabic teams and French capabilities, we navigate the complex intersection of Western diplomatic traditions and Middle Eastern protocol expectations with sophistication and authenticity. Our independence as strategic advisors—not tied to production companies or technical suppliers—enables us to provide unbiased counsel prioritizing client success over commercial relationships, ensuring recommendations protect sovereignty, enhance reputation, and achieve strategic communication objectives. Operating across the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, and wider African markets, G2 serves governments, royal families, foreign ministries, diplomatic missions, international organizations (UN, FIFA, IOC, WEF), sovereign wealth funds, national tourism boards, and luxury brands seeking authentic market entry strategies. Our proven methodology integrates traditional diplomatic protocol with modern event technology, data-driven decision making, scenario planning, and crisis management readiness to deliver flawless execution for events ranging from intimate diplomatic receptions of 100 guests to massive public celebrations of 180,000 attendees, all under intense global media scrutiny and where failure carries significant consequences for national reputation and international relations.",
