# Schema.org Comprehensive Implementation Guide
## G2 Middle East & Africa - 2025 Best Practices

**Generated:** 2025-10-28  
**Purpose:** Complete production-ready JSON-LD structured data optimized for search engines and AI/LLM systems  
**Target:** Dominate government event management, strategic advisory, and diplomatic protocol queries in MENA region

---

## Executive Summary

### Current State Audit
**Findings from codebase analysis:**
- ✅ **Team.tsx**: Extensive Person schema for Tim Jacobs (64 occurrences) - well-implemented
- ✅ **Services.tsx**: Basic Organization + OfferCatalog structure - needs enhancement
- ❌ **Home.tsx**: NO schema markup - critical gap
- ❌ **Projects pages**: Minimal Event schema - major opportunity
- ❌ **Blog/Perspectives**: NO Article schema - missing rich results
- ❌ **Group.tsx**: Basic markup only - needs parent organization links
- ❌ **FAQPage**: Not implemented - high-value for voice search
- ❌ **BreadcrumbList**: Not implemented - navigation clarity

### Recommended Priorities (Implementation Order)
1. **CRITICAL**: Organization schema on every page (establishes entity)
2. **HIGH**: FAQPage (captures voice search + AI queries)
3. **HIGH**: Enhanced Service schema with AI-optimized keywords
4. **HIGH**: Event schema for major projects (Papal Mass, Queen Elizabeth II, COP27, etc.)
5. **MEDIUM**: Article/BlogPosting for perspectives
6. **MEDIUM**: BreadcrumbList for navigation
7. **MEDIUM**: Enhanced Person schema for team members

---

## 1. Organization Schema (Global - Use on Every Page)

**Purpose:** Establishes G2 Middle East as the primary entity. Must appear on EVERY page of the site. This is the foundation that all other schemas reference.

**Placement:** `<head>` section or just before `</body>` on every page

**AI/LLM Optimization Notes:**
- `knowsAbout` field is critical for AI understanding domain expertise
- `sameAs` links to authoritative sources boost entity recognition
- `areaServed` targets geographic queries
- Rich `description` with keywords helps LLM context

## 2. FAQPage Schema (High-Value for Voice Search & AI)

**Purpose:** Captures common queries about government event management, strategic advisory, and G2's credentials. Critical for voice search and AI/LLM question-answering systems.

**Placement:** Create dedicated `/faq` page or embed on homepage

**AI/LLM Optimization Notes:**
- Questions mirror natural language queries used in voice search
- Answers packed with keywords and entity mentions
- Establishes expertise for "who is the best..." queries

This approach is essential for government events where success is measured by diplomatic breakthroughs, enhanced national reputation, and strategic partnerships—not just flawless logistics."

## 4. Event Schema - Major Projects (High-Value for Brand Authority)

**Purpose:** Showcase G2's major project portfolio with rich Event schema. These establish credentials and appear in event-related searches.

**Placement:** Individual project detail pages (e.g., `/projects/papal-mass-2019`, `/projects/queen-elizabeth-ii-state-visit`)

**AI/LLM Optimization Notes:**
- `eventStatus` shows completed work (builds trust)
- Rich `description` with geopolitical context
- `organizer` links back to organization entity
- `location` provides geographic targeting

### Example 1: Papal Mass Abu Dhabi 2019

## 5. Service Schema - Enhanced with AI Keywords

**AI/LLM Optimization Notes:**
- `serviceType` uses industry standard terms
- `termsOfService` links to legal framework
- `areaServed` targets geographic queries
- `hasOfferCatalog` structures sub-services

### Example: Sovereign Communications & Nation Branding Service

## 7. BreadcrumbList Schema - Navigation Enhancement

**Purpose:** Improve navigation understanding for search engines and screen readers. Helps with site structure comprehension.

**Placement:** On all pages (dynamically generated based on URL path)

**Example: Service Detail Page**

```json

  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "name": "Home",
      "item": "https://g2middleeast.com"

    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 2,
      "name": "Services",
      "item": "https://g2middleeast.com/services"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 3,
      "name": "Sovereign Communications",
      "item": "https://g2middleeast.com/services/sovereign-communications"
    }
  ]
}
```
