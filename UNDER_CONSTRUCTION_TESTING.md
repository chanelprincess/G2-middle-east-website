## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: AI Crawlers Blocked

**Symptom:** Googlebot/GPTBot seeing Under Construction

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check middleware file
cat /home/user/webapp/src/middleware/site-access-hybrid.ts

# Verify user agent patterns include the crawler
# Deploy again if needed
```

### Issue 2: Token Not Working

**Symptom:** Token in URL but still see Under Construction

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify token in middleware
grep "SITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" /home/user/webapp/src/middleware/site-access-hybrid.ts

# Should show: const SITE_ACCESS_TOKEN = 'g2me-preview-2025'
```

### Issue 3: Schema Not Visible

**Symptom:** Google Rich Results Test shows no schema

**Solution:**
```bash
# Test with Googlebot user agent
curl -A "Googlebot/2.1" https://g2-middle-east-zuj.pages.dev/team/tim-jacobs

# Should see <script type="application/ld+json"> in output
```

## üìû Stakeholder Access Links

**Share these links with team/clients for full site access:**

### Homepage:
```
https://g2-middle-east-zuj.pages.dev?access=g2me-preview-2025
```

### Services:
```
https://g2-middle-east-zuj.pages.dev/services?access=g2me-preview-2025
```

### Team:

https://g2-middle-east-zuj.pages.dev/team?access=g2me-preview-2025
```

### Projects (requires separate auth):
```
https://g2-middle-east-zuj.pages.dev/projects/login
```

**Note:** After first visit with token, users can browse normally without token in URL (cookie persists 30 days).

## üìà Monitoring

### Check Access Patterns:

**Cloudflare Analytics:**
- Monitor page views
- Check user agents
- Verify AI crawler traffic

**Expected Traffic:**
- Human visitors: Under Construction page only
- AI crawlers: All pages
- Token holders: All pages

---

## üéâ Next Steps

### When Ready to Go Fully Public:

1. **Remove under construction check:**
   ```typescript
   // In src/index.tsx, replace homepage route with:
   app.get('/', (c) => {
     return c.render(<HomePage />, { /* props */ })
   })
   ```

2. **Remove middleware from other routes** (if applied)

3. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name g2-middle-east
   ```

4. **Announce launch** to stakeholders
