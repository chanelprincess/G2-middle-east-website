## ‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR IMPROVEMENTS (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing Sitemap File
**Issue:** Referenced sitemap doesn't exist yet
```
Sitemap: https://g2middleeast.com/sitemap_index.xml
```

**Current Status:** ‚ùå Sitemap not yet created  
**Priority:** üü° MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Moderate - Search engines rely on sitemaps for efficient crawling

**Recommendation:** Create XML sitemap with:
- All public pages (homepage, services, team, contact, projects, perspectives)
- Last modified dates
- Change frequency
- Priority values

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Option 1: Manual XML sitemap creation
/home/user/webapp/public/sitemap.xml

# Option 2: Dynamic sitemap generation in Hono
# Add route: app.get('/sitemap.xml', generateSitemap)
```

---

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing llms.txt File
**Issue:** Referenced llms.txt doesn't exist yet
```
# LLMs/AI: See https://g2middleeast.com/llms.txt for structured company data
```

**Current Status:** ‚ùå llms.txt not yet created  
**Priority:** üü° MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Moderate - Modern best practice for AI crawler optimization

**Recommendation:** Create llms.txt with structured data:
```

---

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Redundant Allow Rules
**Issue:** Some Allow rules are redundant (already covered by `Allow: /`)

**Example:**
```
User-agent: *
Allow: /                    # ‚Üê Allows everything by default
...
Allow: /projects/           # ‚Üê Redundant (already allowed)
Allow: /team/               # ‚Üê Redundant (already allowed)
```

**Priority:** üü¢ LOW  
**Impact:** None - just makes file slightly longer

**Recommendation:** These can stay - they serve as explicit documentation of important paths even though technically redundant. Not urgent to change.

---

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è No Request-Rate Directive
**Issue:** Missing Request-rate directive (optional extension)

**Current:** Only Crawl-delay is used  
**Optional Addition:**
```
User-agent: Googlebot
Request-rate: 1/10s  # 1 request per 10 seconds (alternative to Crawl-delay)
```

**Priority:** üü¢ LOW  
**Impact:** Minimal - Crawl-delay already handles rate limiting

**Recommendation:** Not necessary - current Crawl-delay configuration is sufficient.
