## 🎨 Optimization Applied

The new image maintains the same optimization standards as the rest of the website:

✅ **GenSpark CDN**: Automatic WebP format conversion  
✅ **Lazy Loading**: `loading="lazy"` attribute for below-fold image  
✅ **Explicit Dimensions**: `width="800" height="600"` prevents layout shift (CLS)  
✅ **Responsive Sizing**: Full width with object-cover for consistent display  
✅ **Rounded Styling**: `rounded-lg shadow-2xl` maintains visual consistency  
✅ **Alt Text**: Descriptive "Building Cultural Capital" for accessibility  

### CDN Optimization Benefits
- Automatic format negotiation (WebP, AVIF for modern browsers)
- Global edge delivery for fast load times
- Automatic compression and quality optimization
- No manual image processing required
